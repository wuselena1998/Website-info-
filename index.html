    <h2>What is Radiation?</h2>
    <p>Radiation is energy that travels through space. Some types of radiation can be seen, like visible light, while others are invisible, like X-rays and gamma rays.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Types of Radiation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alpha Particles:</strong> Heavy, positively charged particles that can be stopped by paper or skin.</li>
      <li><strong>Beta Particles:</strong> Lighter, negatively charged particles that can penetrate further but are blocked by materials like plastic or glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Gamma Rays:</strong> Highly penetrating electromagnetic radiation requiring dense materials like lead for shielding.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sources of Radiation</h2>
    <p>Natural sources include the sun, soil, rocks, and even food. Man-made sources include medical imaging (like X-rays), nuclear reactors, and industrial equipment.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Radiation Safety</h2>
    <p>Radiation exposure can be minimized by using three main principles: time, distance, and shielding.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Limit the time spent near a radiation source.</li>
      <li>Increase distance from the radiation source.</li>
      <li>Use appropriate shielding to block or reduce radiation exposure.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Learn About Radiation?</h2>
    <p>Understanding radiation helps promote safety and smart decision-making, especially for people working in healthcare, nuclear energy, and research industries.</p>
